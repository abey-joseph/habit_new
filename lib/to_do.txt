-- need to save data based on user ID 

i mean if a user enter some data and logout then login again using a diff account the data must not be there 

but if login using the same account then can show

also if the user login with a diff account the old data can be deleted


*** PENDING ADD HIVE FOR EDIT DATA (also need to include the check box data also)

*** need to make a fucntion which will check if the current date and last entry date of each habit if it is empty
- then fill up with data put complettion status as empty


////// need make the bloc more efficent 
 - i have an idea like the main bloc have some more states where one state trigger when there is a change in the length of habit lidt
 - other one will trigger for all the other case when needed a refresh but only the minumum widgets will be depend on it - or only the needed one will be the reloaded
